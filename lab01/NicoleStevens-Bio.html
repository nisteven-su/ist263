I am Nicole Stevens. I am a Policy Studies major with a minor in Information Management and Technology. I am interested in Policy Studies as it provides students with useful skills for the workplace. At Syracuse University, I have received an academic scholarship and have made it on the Deanâ€™s List every semester. However, my personal life, I enjoy going on hikes and traveling. I studied abroad in London. While abroad, I had the opportunity of traveling to 10 countries. My favorite place that I visited was Greece where I have family roots. My father and mother grew up in Greece. Therefore, it was really cool to see the place where my family was raised.
