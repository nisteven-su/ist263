        <h2>About Me:</h2>
        <img class= "me" src="../Media/bio.png" alt="picture of author">
        <p>I am Nicole Stevens and a senior at Syracuse University. I will be graduating in May 2021 with an undergraduate degree in Policy Studies and a minor in Information Management and Technology. Over my time at Syracuse University, I discovered my growing interest in entering the retail world. I have completed internships at PVH Corp and Ted Baker. From these experiences, I have gained insights on how clothing is manufactured. Therefore, I have gained an understanding of how fast fashion has caused detrimental effects on our planet. In order to combat these growing issues, I believe that investing in “slow” fashion is beneficial to the consumer and the environment. </p>
